Discern
====================

Overview
---------------------
This is an API wrapper around EASE to create a service to grade arbitrary free text responses.
This is licensed under the AGPL, please see LICENSE.txt for details.
The goal here is to provide a high-performance, scalable solution that can effectively help students learn.
Feedback is a major part of this process, the feedback system has been left very flexible on purpose (you will see this later on).

Note that you will need the ease repository to use all of the functionality here.  This repo is now open source.  You will need to install both repos in the same directory.  Install directions for ease can be found at [Github](https://github.com/edx/ease)

About this repo
---------------
DISCERN and EASE were primarily developed by Vik Paruchuri, under my supervision. edX is no longer maintaining DISCERN, and dropped the repo from the edX org, taking a snapshot of Master (but no version history). This is that last snapshot.

Examples and getting started
-----------------------
Please see docs/installation for installation information.  Examples can be found in docs/examples.  A built version of these can be found at [ReadtheDocs](http://discern.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), or you can feel free to clone the repo and build these yourself.

How to Contribute
-----------------
Contributions are very welcome. The easiest way is to fork this repo, and then
make a pull request from your fork. 


The current backlog is in the [issues section](http://github.com/edx/discern/issues?labels=&page=1&state=open).
Please feel free to open new issues or work on existing ones.

Detailed Information
-------------------------
Please look in the docs folder for more detailed documentation.  There is a README there that explains how to build
and view the docs.
