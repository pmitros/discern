Discern
====================

Questions? (Mailing List/IRC Channel)
---------------------
Feel free to open an issue in the issue tracker, or use [this link](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#edx-discern) to access an IRC chat room for real time
communication with some of the edX developers.  Alternatively, you can use your own IRC chat client and point it at freenode(chat.freenode.net).  The channel is #edx-discern.

We also have a [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/edx-discern).  Feel free to ask questions and discuss the code there.  If you find an issue (unless it is a security issue, see below), please mention it on our issue tracker.

Overview
---------------------
This is an API wrapper for a service to grade arbitrary free text responses.
This is licensed under the AGPL, please see LICENSE.txt for details.
The goal here is to provide a high-performance, scalable solution that can effectively help students learn.
Feedback is a major part of this process, the feedback system has been left very flexible on purpose (you will see this later on).

Note that you will need the ease repository to use all of the functionality here.  This repo is now open source.  You will need to install both repos in the same directory.  Install directions for ease can be found at [Github](https://github.com/edx/ease)

Examples and getting started
-----------------------
Please see docs/installation for installation information.  Examples can be found in docs/examples.  A built version of these can be found at [ReadtheDocs](http://discern.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), or you can feel free to clone the repo and build these yourself.
